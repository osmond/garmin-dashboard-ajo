## Commit Message Guidelines

Write commit messages in the present-tense imperative, describing what the commit does. Keep the summary short and descriptive. For example:

- "Add port configuration"
- "Fix login redirect logic"

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Garmin credentials and InfluxDB connection details.
2. Run `npm install` in the `api` folder.
3. Start the API with `npm start` in the `api` folder.
4. From `frontend/react-app`, run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the React app.
